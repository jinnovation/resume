** Overrides + Patches

   Some of the upstream styling isn't to my personal liking, so we'll override
   some of that in this section.

*** Header overrides

    Upstream, the name header bolds and smallcaps the last name, which I'm not a
    huge fan of. We'll set it to simply bolden the name, increase the text size,
    and color it w/ the "accent color" defined upstream.

    Similarly, the subtitle that contains the "tagline" is also formatted with
    the accent color as well as bolded, which I'm not a fan of. We'll set it
    here to simply be large text.

    #+begin_src latex
      \renewcommand\user[2]{\color{accentcolor}{\LARGE\textbf{#1 #2}}\color{Black}}

      \renewcommand\resumetitle[1]{
        %% \ifundef{\@alternative}{
        %%    \par{
        %%    	 \bigskip\center{\Large \color{accentcolor}\textbf{#1}\color{Black}}\par
        %%    }
        %%    \bigskip
        %% }{
          \large{#1}
        %% }
      }
    #+end_src

*** Dimensions

    Something about how upstream specifies the width of the "right column" --
    which contains the job titles and associated bullet points -- is a little
    off. As a result, text flows past the header horizontal line rule, which
    isn't a good look. We manually compensate here.

    #+begin_src latex
      \setleftcolumnlength{1.5cm}
      \setlength{\rightcolumnlength}{\dimexpr(\rightcolumnlength-0.5cm)\relax}

    #+end_src

** Extensions

*** Experience entries with blurbs

    I'd like to have each entry in the experience section have a "blurb"
    providing high-level overview of the nature of the work, e.g. team and
    organization and general focus areas. This command is a copy-paste of the
    upstream =\experience= with an additional field to that effect.

    #+begin_src latex
      \newcommand\experiencewithblurb[8]{
        #1    & \textbf{\accentcolor{#2}} \textsc{#3} \hfill #4   \\*
        #5    & \textit{#6} \\*
              & \begin{minipage}[t]{\rightcolumnlength}
                  #7
                \end{minipage}									\\*
              & \footnotesize{\foreach \n in {#8}{\cvtag{\n}}} 	\\
      }
    #+end_src

*** Icon-less section headers

    #+begin_src latex
      \newcommand\sectionHeader[1]{\section{\texorpdfstring{\color{accentcolor}\textsc{#1}}{#1}}}
    #+end_src

*** Accentuate arbitrary text

    A convenience command to color arbitrary text with the accent color.

    #+begin_src latex
      \newcommand\accentcolor[1]{\color{accentcolor}#1\color{Black}}

             tooling, explicit reliability guarantees (SLOs), etc.;

           \item Implemented formalized SLO tracking for multi-cluster, pipeline
             execution infrastructure; used Terraform to canonicalize SLO definitions
             for monitoring and violation reporting in Google Cloud Monitoring;
             implemented custom Kubernetes listener to implement nuanced and
             domain-specific SLIs.
