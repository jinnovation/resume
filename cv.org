** Overrides + Patches

   Some of the upstream styling isn't to my personal liking, so we'll override
   some of that in this section.

*** Header overrides

    Upstream, the name header bolds and smallcaps the last name, which I'm not a
    huge fan of. We'll set it to simply bolden the name, increase the text size,
    and color it w/ the "accent color" defined upstream.

    Similarly, the subtitle that contains the "tagline" is also formatted with
    the accent color as well as bolded, which I'm not a fan of. We'll set it
    here to simply be large text.

    #+begin_src latex
      \renewcommand\user[2]{\color{accentcolor}{\LARGE\textbf{#1 #2}}\color{Black}}

      \renewcommand\resumetitle[1]{
        %% \ifundef{\@alternative}{
        %%    \par{
        %%    	 \bigskip\center{\Large \color{accentcolor}\textbf{#1}\color{Black}}\par
        %%    }
        %%    \bigskip
        %% }{
          \large{#1}
        %% }
      }
    #+end_src

*** Dimensions

    Something about how upstream specifies the width of the "right column" --
    which contains the job titles and associated bullet points -- is a little
    off. As a result, text flows past the header horizontal line rule, which
    isn't a good look. We manually compensate here.

    #+begin_src latex
      \setleftcolumnlength{1.5cm}
      \setlength{\rightcolumnlength}{\dimexpr(\rightcolumnlength-0.5cm)\relax}

    #+end_src

** Extensions

*** Experience entries with blurbs

    I'd like to have each entry in the experience section have a "blurb"
    providing high-level overview of the nature of the work, e.g. team and
    organization and general focus areas. This command is a copy-paste of the
    upstream =\experience= with an additional field to that effect.

    #+begin_src latex
      \newcommand\experiencewithblurb[8]{
        #1    & \textbf{\accentcolor{#2}} \textsc{#3} \hfill #4   \\*
        #5    & \textit{#6} \\*
              & \begin{minipage}[t]{\rightcolumnlength}
                  #7
                \end{minipage}									\\*
              & \footnotesize{\foreach \n in {#8}{\cvtag{\n}}} 	\\
      }
    #+end_src

*** Icon-less section headers

    #+begin_src latex
      \newcommand\sectionHeader[1]{\section{\texorpdfstring{\color{accentcolor}\textsc{#1}}{#1}}}
    #+end_src

*** Accentuate arbitrary text

    A convenience command to color arbitrary text with the accent color.

      \newcommand\accentcolor[1]{\color{accentcolor}#1\color{Black}}

             \item Tech lead for Hendrix's experiment-tracking layer. Led team of
               four engineers to deliver an MLflow-based MVP in half a
               quarter. Responsible for defining the strategy and roadmap for
               experiment-tracking and artifact management within Hendrix;

             \item Spearheaded the development of the Hendrix Registry as part of
               company-wide AI/ML governance initiative; collaborated with
               stakeholders in Legal, Trust \& Safety, etc. to deliver an

               100 models registered by 40 teams company-wide in less than a quarter;

             \item Led multi-quarter promotion of ML Platform's flagship
               Kubeflow-based orchestration product to general availability;
               collaborated with product and engineering stakeholders across peer
               teams within ML Platform as well as ``power user'' teams -- other
               applied ML teams at Spotify -- to: define multi-quarter engineering
               roadmap; provide technical and project
               leadership/direction. Contributed to an increase in ML Platform
               adoption of 50\% and increase in user satisfaction of 10\%.

             \item Providing ongoing mentorship and support to three junior IC team
               members, i.e. half of the team's IC makeup; holding bi-weekly
               one-on-ones with each to: provide technical and career mentorship;
               help identify potential future ownership areas and unblock existing
               ones; and address ongoing concerns.

           \item Bootstrapping early-stage development of centralized, managed Ray
             infrastructure based on KubeRay for high-performance ML prototyping and
             experimentation; collaborating with product and engineering leadership
             to concretize our platform's long-term Ray strategy;
