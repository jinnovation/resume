    {Present}
    {Spotify}
    {Senior Machine Learning Engineer}
    {New York}
    {03/2021}
    {
      Member of ML Platform. Working on
      \link{https://twimlai.com/conf/twimlcon/2022/session/how-spotify-is-navigating-an-evolving-ml-landscape-with-hendrix-platform/}{Hendrix},
      Spotify's centralized ML platform. My focuses revolve around: ML
      governance; cloud-native infra; and SDK development for MLOps.
    }
    {
      \begin{itemize}

        \item Spearheaded the development of the Hendrix Registry as part of
          company-wide AI/ML governance initiative, delivering a Backstage-based
          \link{https://ai.meta.com/blog/system-cards-a-new-resource-for-understanding-how-ai-systems-work/}{AI
            system } and \link{https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.03993}{model card }
          solution, resulting in over 100 models registered by 40 teams
          company-wide in under a quarter;

        \item Driving cross-functional collaboration between ML Platform and
          Data Platform on data- and ML-native lineage solutions to empower
          responsible AI development, manage costs, and codify org-wide best
          practices and ML development standards;

        \item Led multi-quarter promotion of ML Platform's flagship pipeline
          orchestration product to general availability; collaborated with
          product and engineering stakeholders across peer teams within ML
          Platform as well as ``power user'' teams -- other applied ML teams at
          Spotify -- to: define multi-quarter engineering roadmap; provide
          technical and project leadership/direction. Contributed to an increase
          in ML Platform adoption of 50\% and increase in user satisfaction of
          10\%.

        \item Providing ongoing mentorship and support to three junior IC team
          members, i.e. half of the team's IC makeup; holding bi-weekly
          one-on-ones with each to: provide technical and career mentorship;
          help identify potential future ownership areas and unblock existing
          ones; and address ongoing concerns.

%%       \item Implemented formalized SLO tracking for multi-cluster, pipeline
%%         execution infrastructure; used Terraform to canonicalize SLO definitions
%%         for monitoring and violation reporting in Google Cloud Monitoring;
%%         implemented custom Kubernetes listener to implement nuanced and
%%         domain-specific SLIs.

      \item Bootstrapping early-stage development of centralized, managed Ray
        infrastructure based on KubeRay for high-performance ML prototyping and
        experimentation; collaborating with product and engineering leadership
        to concretize our platform's long-term Ray strategy;

    {NVIDIA}
    {Senior Systems Software Engineer, AI Infrastructure}
    {New York}
    {12/2019}
    {Member of AI Infrastructure. Contributor to
      \link{https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2018/09/13/how-maglev-speeds-autonomous-vehicles-to-superhuman-levels-of-safety/}{MagLev},
      NVIDIA’s AI infrastructure for autonomous vehicle development. Also
      contributed to Modulus, the deep learning SDK for autonomous vehicle
      R\&D.}
    {
      \begin{itemize}
      \item Initiated development of solution for ``hybrid data/model
        parallelism'' using a Ray-based parameter server design and Horovod to
        enable horizontally-scalable multi-task training;
      \item Co-delivered a Kubernetes-based scheduling mechanism to enable
        priority access to cluster resources for select use cases, e.g. prep for
        upcoming external demos, via virtual ``resource shares'';
      \end{itemize}

    {New York}
    {08/2018}
    {Member of \link{http://cortex.twitter.com}{Cortex}, Twitter's central ML
      platform organization. Worked on: workflow orchestration; experiment
      management/iteration; and overall ML engineering productivity.}
    {
      \begin{itemize}
      \item
        Spearheaded initial integration of
        \link{http://tensorflow.org/tfx/}{TensorFlow Extended (TFX)} with
